              <p>Camm was founded in 2019 by German entrepreneur Christoph Bertsch, who was searching for a real sustainable material solution for one of his health & lifestyle companies. He came across an available technology based on polyvinyl alcohol, known from the plastic wrapper of dishwasher tabs. The innovation was the combination of PVOH and organic additives, which creates a stable and pliable material. Different formulations allow camm to be used for a wide range of potential applications. <br>
                Having found a suitable technology, Christoph built an infrastructure of employees, partners, companies and investors, creating a competitive web of chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and raw material sourcing. This allows a significant scale-up of the camm material and its commercialization, while ensuring a high level of sustainability.

              <p>Camm is a sustainable alternative to plastics and composite packaging. This material is set to be fully bio-based, since it can be made from bio-waste that stems from renewable materials. Camm is certified water-soluble, compostable and easily recyclable. IF it ends up as litter in the worst case, camm decomposes without leaving behind any substances harmful to the environment – not even nano- or microplastics. This makes camm stand apart from other polymers. And with its versatile properties and various end-of-life scenarios, camm will be capable of replacing plastics and composite materials at scale in all kinds of industries and applications, across many countries and regions.

              <p>In essence, camm is made from a chemical reaction of biogas and bio-alcohol with acetic acid. Thanks to a combination of patented material innovations, camm can be formulated with a variable combination of customizable specifications (e.g. gas barrier properties). camm can already today be considered as over 80% sustainable, because of its strong material properties, creating no harm to the environment. It is our goal to make this material fully renewable by 2025. This means that all conventional components will be replaced by renewable feedstocks produced from agricultural waste (e.g. sugar cane), thanks to partnerships in the supply chain (supplemented by small quantities of bio-based materials from other sources). The related waste streams neither compete with food production nor do they increase land use. </p>

              <p><b>Although camm is based on a synthetic polymer (PVOH) and has a plastic-like look and feel, we do not consider it a plastic, </b> due to its natural and ecological behavior. And this is why:
                The base material PVOH will soon be renewable, due to green supply chains that are currently being established. Camm already incorporates most properties required to call it fully natural and ecological: Camm material is completely biodegradable, compostable, water-soluble and recyclable. It doesn’t generate microplastics, nor does it leave behind synthetic traces such as nano plastics. Even though the PVOH currently used is still fossil-based, studies show that most of the carbon used is not in fact emitted, but rather bound back into the soil, especially in connection with water. Camm is designed to be fully circular, all the way from renewable natural inputs to renewable natural outputs, and can be recycled. </p>

            <a href="">How does camm differ from other bioplastics, especially PLA?
              <span class="customicon customicon-angle-bottom"></span>
            </a>
            <div class="body">
              <p>PLA is a bio-based plastic, which is hard to process due to its material properties. Although it’s the most commonly used plastic to replace conventional plastics and counts as biodegradable and compostable, PLA takes years to decompose naturally, and can even generate nano- and microplastics in the process. It can therefore only be properly composted and biodegraded in industrial facilities. <br>
                In comparison, camm has an array of advantages, most notably its exceptional water solubility and fast biodegradation in natural environments, while offering must-have material properties for industrial applications. Camm is also cost-competitive compared to bioplastics and premium conventional applications and will ultimately be cost-competitive with mainstream conventional plastics at scale. It is also certified biodegradable and home compostable, while PLA is not.</p>

            <a href="">What are microplastics and why are they bad?

            </a>
            <div class="body">
              <p>Microplastics are microscopic solid particles made of synthetic polymers that are insoluble in water and typically resistant to biodegradation in an aquatic environment. <br>
                Although our understanding of microplastics is still evolving, California’s proposed definition refers to particles that are solid (i.e. not water soluble) polymeric materials, which have at least three dimensions greater than 1nm and less than 5,000 micrometers (µm). Such plastics may be intentionally added to products (e.g. as microbeads) or result from progressive physical fragmentation of plastic objects into progressively smaller particles, which may take place in the environment. Such particles can be ingested and potentially transferred along food chains. <br>
                Furthermore, microplastics are practically impossible to remove from the environment after their release. They are being found in embryos, animals and even in the Arctic. The impact on the human body and natural habitats are yet to be fully understood. As plastics regularly contain harmful substances, negative effects are to be expected.</p>

              <p>No. The formula is adjusted in accordance with the required specifications, most importantly the desired end-of-life scenario, to ensure that camm delivers the desired properties.

              There’s so much paper-based packaging already.

            <div class="body">
              <p>The technical requirements for food packaging (e.g. gas and grease barrier) can typically only be achieved with composite materials. However, composite materials result in high ecological costs, as they are fossil-based and usually coated with PE, EVOH and/or aluminum. Depending on their structure, they severely or partially inhibit functional recycling. Conventional composite materials often end up in landfill or incineration, where they will emit CO2 that was previously bound in the material. In addition, they release nano- and microplastics into organisms and the environment. <br>
                Camm paper and carton applications are different. They provide the necessary functions of water, gas, grease and oxygen barriers with a biodegradable and water-soluble alternative. Because camm will simply dissolve in the recycling paper pulper, the paper fibers are protected, preventing fiber loss and allowing them to stay in the circular loop. In the ensuing water treatment, any remnants of camm and its additives are fully biodegraded, returning back to nature as natural material. That is why camm leaves no trace in the form of nano- or microplastics. </p>

              <p>Camm is certified compostable. The disintegration in compost at ambient temperatures (home compostability) was tested and certified by OWS Belgium. After only 12 weeks of composting, all test material had disappeared completely and none could be retrieved from composting. Depending on the formula, the biodegradation speed can be as short as a couple of minutes to days. <br>
                Side note: In countries with well-functioning recycling systems, for example Germany, we prefer to design camm applications with an extended period of biodegradation. The purpose of these applications is for them to stay in the recycling loop in order to be re-used in new applications. From a sustainability perspective this is the most environmentally friendly approach to products and materials. Having said that, if these applications leave the recycling loop and end up in the environment, they also biodegrade in a matter of months and leave no synthetic traces behind, not even nano plastics. </p>

              <p>We plan to produce camm from 100% renewable materials by the end of 2025. <br>
                The challenge we’re currently facing is a general shortage of bio-ethanol and bio-ethylene, due to the limited availability of feedstocks and converting facilities. To tackle this challenge head on, we’re establishing regional supply chains for feedstock made from bio-waste, which stems from renewable materials. Agreements with local producers are already underway, with sugar mills in Latin America at the top of our list. Here, we will cooperate with the sugar mills to generate bio-ethanol 2.0 on the basis of bagasse and molasse, with an on-site processing infrastructure for producing camm material. We’re looking into similar options in Europe as well, ffor example using sugar beet waste as the basis. <br>
                While camm material might only be partially renewable at this time, its properties are already almost fully sustainable today: <br>
                - Fully biodegradable, compostable, water soluble and recycleable<br>
                - generates no microplastics<br>
                - Leaves behind no synthetic traces, such as nanoplastics or hazardous substances<br>
                - Binds carbon in wet environments, emits only small amounts in arid environments<br>
