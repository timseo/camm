          <h2>CAMM SOLUTIONS <span>(by Bertsch Industries)</span></h2>
          <h3>is a greentech platform that
            develops fully sustainable and
            commercially viable material
            solutions - “camm” - to combat
            global (micro)plastic pollution
            and eliminate waste.</h3>
            <p>Camm was started in 2019 by the German entrepreneur Christoph Bertsch who was searching for an authentic sustainable material solution for one of his health & lifestyle companies. Out of his enquiry emerged a drop-in alternative to plastics and composite materials that is commercially scalable.</p>

      <div class="middle-part">
        <div class="container">
          <p>The material will be fully biobased and can be made out of bio waste from renewables. It is water soluble, compostable and easily recyclable. </p>

              <p>Even if ending up as litter in the environment, camm leaves nothing harmful behind. Flexible regarding its features and end-of-life scenarios, camm will be able to replace conventional plastics and composite materials in many industries, applications, countries & regions.
                <br><br>
                The mission of Camm Solutions is not only to create the most sustainable technology for the polymer and packaging field, but also to ensure it can be successfully implemented in the mainstream rather than only the niche. The planet needs scaled change to recover from the environmental disaster caused by plastic pollution.
                This is why camm is being built as a platform designed to scale from the start: at all steps of the value chain – from raw material to recycling, the continuously growing Camm community is being joined by strategic partners – mainly family owned businesses and entrepreneurs. They bring know-how, network and capital to the table for scaled production of renewable raw materials and scaled market entry.
